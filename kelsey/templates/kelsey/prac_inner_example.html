    For example, imagine the elements of the contract are given by the numbers above.
    You will be asked to make the following decisions:
    {% include 'kelsey/example_first_decision.html' %}

    <ul class="list-group striped">
        <li class="list-group-item">…if you choose
            <input type="radio" name="inlineRadioOptions" id="inlineRadio1" disabled value="option1 ">
            <strong>No</strong>, you earn 0 in this round and you go to the next round.
        </li>


        <li class="list-group-item">…if you choose <input type="radio" name="inlineRadioOptions" id="inlineRadio1"
                                                          disabled value="option1 ">
            <strong>Yes</strong>, you are then taken to a different screen with
            information that depends on which of the randomly determined payoffs is drawn.
        </li>


        <li class="list-group-item">
            With {{ p }}% probability, you will receive {{ Constants.q_parameters.low_payoff|c }}
             (the low payoff will be drawn with {{ p }}% probability).
            Since the payoff of {{ Constants.q_parameters.low_payoff|c }} is less than the
            final investment cost of {{ Constants.q_parameters.final_cost|c }},
            you will not be charged the final investment cost.
            So you will see the following:
            <div class="well">{% include 'kelsey/result_block.html' with first_decision=1 investment_payoff=Constants.q_parameters.low_payoff show_final_investment_block=0 payoff=Constants.q_parameters.initial_cost|inv %}</div>
        </li>


        <li class="list-group-item">
            with {{ p_1 }}% chance, you will
            receive {{ Constants.q_parameters.high_payoff|c }} (the high payoff will be drawn with {{ p_1 }}%
            probability).
            Since the payoff of {{ Constants.q_parameters.high_payoff|c }}
            is greater than the final
            investment cost of {{ Constants.q_parameters.final_cost|c }},
            so you will be charged the final investment cost.
            So you will see the following:
            <div class="well">
                {% include 'kelsey/result_block.html' with first_decision=1 investment_payoff=Constants.q_parameters.high_payoff  show_final_investment_block=1 payoff=Constants.q_parameters.PT0ExampleHigh %}
