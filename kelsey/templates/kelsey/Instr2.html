                <p>The experiment has two separate parts. Each part of the experiment has {{ Constants.first_half }}
                    rounds.</p>
                <p>Your final payment will add up all of your decisions across all {{ Constants.first_half }} rounds in
                    both Parts.</p>
                <p>In each round, you will be offered an investment contract.</p>
                <h4>You will earn points for each round. At the end of the entire session (Parts 1 and 2). Your total
                    earnings will be converted to US dollars with an exchange rate of <strong>100 points = $1</strong>.</h4>
                <p>You will have the option to turn on the instructions on every following page using a button that
                    looks like this <img class="media-object" data-src="holder.js/64x64" alt="jar_pic"
                                         style="width: auto; height:40px; display:inline-block"
                                         src="{% static 'img/inst_slider.png' %}"
                                         data-holder-rendered="true" data-pin-nopin="true"></p>
                <p> If you see this button: <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign blue"
                                                  aria-hidden="true"></span></span>,
                    hovering over it will reveal further explanation.</p>
                <p>We will explain the instructions for Part 1 next. After you finish Part 1,
                    we will explain the instructions for Part 2.</p>
                <p>After you see the instructions for each part, you will have two practice rounds that will not
                    contribute to your earnings before going on to the real rounds.
                    You will also be asked a few comprehension questions </p>
